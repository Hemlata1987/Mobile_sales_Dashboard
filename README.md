 Mobile Sales Dashboard in Power BI! ðŸ“ŠðŸ“±

I recently built an interactive sales dashboard focused on mobile devices, designed to provide clear and actionable insights. The dashboard includes:

âœ… Month-wise & Model-wise Total Sales
âœ… Total Number of Transactions
âœ… Breakdown by Transaction Methods (Cash, Card, UPI, etc.)
âœ… Customer Ratings Overview

This dashboard helps sales teams and business managers quickly analyze trends, spot best-selling models, and understand customer behavior across different transaction channels.

Power BI's powerful visualization tools made it easy to turn raw data into a meaningful, decision-supporting resource.

Tech Stack
List the key technologies to build the dashboard

Example:
The dashboard was build using the following tools and technologies:
Power Bi Desktop: Main data visualisation platform used for report  creation.
Power Query: Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
DAX(Data Analysis Expression): Used for calculated measures, dynamic values and conditional logic.
Data Modelling: Relatioships established among tables ( Mobile sales, Custom Calendar) to enable cross filtering and aggression.
File format: .pbix for development and .png for dashboard preview.

Features/Highlights:
